JPFM Labs container images for embedded systems/robotics work.

The Robot Operating System (ROS) relies heavily on the Ubuntu Linux
distribution. A lot of embedded work requires arm64/arm7 images. Very few
public images provide good coverage for all these flavours. This repo
contains container images that repackage things for these platforms. These
images are used as the base for our embedded systems/robotics work.
